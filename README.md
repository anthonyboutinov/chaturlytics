# Chaturlytics

_Pet project_

Analytical portal for broadcasters: the web-app periodically pulls client’s data from another platform via REST API, transforms that data for storage and display of broadcaster’s working hours and income statistics in a more meaningful way than what the native solution provides. (MeteorJS, MongoDB, Blaze, Bulma)

This project is made using MeteorJS (https://meteor.com), MongoDB, Blaze, Bulma.
